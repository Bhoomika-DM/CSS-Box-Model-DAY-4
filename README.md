CSS Box Model Demonstration:


This project demonstrates the use of the CSS Box Model, which consists of four main components: margin, border, padding, and content. The box model plays an important role in defining the size and spacing of HTML elements and how they interact with each other on a web page.

Project Structure:


HTML File (index.html): Contains the structure of the webpage, including a simple div element that demonstrates the CSS box model.
CSS File (styles.css): Defines the styling of the elements in the HTML file, focusing on how margin, border, padding, and content are applied to a box.
Layout Overview:


The layout consists of a single box, styled to clearly show the different parts of the box model:

Content: The innermost part of the box where text or other elements are placed.
Padding: The space between the content and the border.
Border: The line surrounding the padding.
Margin: The space outside the border between this box and other elements or the page boundary.

How to Run the Project:


Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.
The browser will load the styled layout, demonstrating how the box model is applied.
You can adjust the padding, margin, or border values in styles.css to see how the box model changes the layout in real-time.
